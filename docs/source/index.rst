Simple Documentation Tutorial
=============================
This is my experimenting with the tutorial at https://youtu.be/oJsUvBQyHBs.  What's also 
cool is that it's supposed to be using my markdown files, so I can compose using the 
system which I'm used to.  This is described here: https://blog.readthedocs.com/adding-markdown-support/.


Another Simple Header
=====================

Here is some text explaining some very complicated stuff.  Version 3.

    print 'hello'
    >> hello
    
For some reason it is still not getting the headers from qfunction.md...
